# A two-step deep learning-based framework for metro tunnel lining defect recognition
Aiming to quickly, accurately, and automatically recognize various defects (leakage, crack, spalling) from massive metro tunnel lining image data, a two-step deep learning-based framework is proposed.
In this repository, the datasets for metro tunnel lining image classification and multi-defect detection are shared for further research. Meanwhile, the algorithms proposed in the paper and related weight files are also shared.
